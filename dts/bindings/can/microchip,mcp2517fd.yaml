description: MCP2515 SPI CAN controller

compatible: "microchip,mcp2517fd"

include: [spi-device.yaml, can-controller.yaml]

properties:
    osc-freq:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Frequency of the external oscillator
    int-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true

        Interrupt pin.

        This pin signals active low when produced by the controller. The
        property value should ensure the flags properly describe the signal
        that is presented to the driver.
    pll-enable:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        Enable the PLL.

        If the PLL is enabled, the oscillator frequency is multiplied by 10.
        Only works if the oscillator frequency is <= 4 MHz.
    reg:
      type: array
      required: true
    clock:
      type: phandle
      required: false
      description: |
        PWM Clock.

        This clock is used to generate the clock using PWM peripheral.
